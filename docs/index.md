 ## What was learned
In the seventh assignment we learned about pickling, unpickling and structured error handling. 
Pickling is a module that implements a binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.
Error handling is also known as exception handling which is something that can alert someone that they input the wrong information.

 ## Lessons learned
This assignment is something that was very intriguing and eye opening on how you can use the error handling in you script with the (except) function.

 ## My script
In this image you can see a sample of what I have put together for my script. You can see a few different things like the 
input_menu_choice and the input_new_user_id_and_user_name, here I also have the strip function to make it if you put a space with the number you input.

 ## In summary
In all I have learned how use the pickling and the error handling in this assignment.
